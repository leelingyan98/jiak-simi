# Jiak Simi?
Pat toh yao, jiak simi meng kia?

Thinking about what to eat every meal is a daily struggle. This app is made to solve that very dilemma!
It includes the recipe and instructions to prepare the meal. Some recipes have a YouTube video for reference.

This app is made with Vite and ReactJS, and the API from [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php).

# How to navigate
There are 4 clickable areas:

1) Home (to return to home page)
2) Saved (to view saved meals)
3) Start here (to view list of categories)
4) Give me a random meal! (retrieves a random meal)

Clicking on "Start here" will bring you to the page of categories. You can click on "Go back" to return to the previous page.

Upon selecting a meal, you will reach the category meal list and you may choose a meal.

The meal page will display the country the food is from, type of category, ingredients with measurements and the instructions. If a YouTube video is available, there will be a button linking to the video.

You may bookmark the meal by clicking on "Save meal!", or unsave it by clicking on "Remove from saved".
